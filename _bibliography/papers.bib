  title={Trajectory tracking of 4-DOF robot manipulator: a bond graph approach},
  author={Singh, Rajmeet and Lamba, Manvir Singh and Bera, Tarun Kumar},
  abstract={This research work presents the design of a position control algorithm for trajectory tracking of a four-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulator. The linkage mechanism of the manipulator is based on a parallelogram mechanism and in this manipulator, three parallelogram mechanisms are used. First, the CAD and the kinematic model of the manipulator are developed. The bond graph (BG) approach is applied to develop the dynamic model of the robotic arm based on kinematic equations. The BG model of parallelogram linkage is then compared with the Simulink model of parallelogram linkage and results are validated. Then, a position control algorithm is proposed to follow a set of trajectory planning applications. A GRBL-Arduino based controller is used to estimate the position of the end-effector as per the user's requirements. The simulation and experimentation work are performed for 3D trajectory tracking applications. The robotic arm is used for pick and place operation within the workspace.},

abstract="Gears are the most critical and commonly used machine elements. They are used for a variety of applications throughout various industries like energy, aerospace, transportation, mining, agriculture, manufacturing, etc. The failure of gear may result in cataclysmic shutdowns causing significant production, economic losses and even human casualties. Fault diagnosis is an important component of condition-based maintenance and it has gained much attention for the safe operation of the gearboxes. But in many applications, fault diagnosis is not accurate. Sensor-based condition monitoring systems help in enhancing the quality of measurement data. A lot of research has been done in developing machine learning algorithms and models to extract information of fault status from the sensor data. Data acquisition of the meaningful sensor data from the gearbox is an open challenge. This makes the estimation of the remaining useful time of gearbox more challenging. This paper presents a literature review of the different IoT-based techniques used to acquire health status data from the gearbox.",

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
