Welcome to my portfolio website! I am an incoming graduate student at the University of California San Diego. I will pursue a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering specializing in Control & Mechatronics.

My academic journey began at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology (TIET) in Patiala, India, where I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Mechatronics Engineering. I maintained a stellar GPA of 3.8 throughout my undergraduate years and was honored to be a Merit Scholarship holder during 2020-2022. 

As an ardent learner, I sought opportunities to complement my academic pursuits with practical experiences. I undertook research positions at various esteemed institutions, including Mechatronics LAB at TIET, TIET-Tel Aviv University Centre for Food Security (T2CEFS), Mechatronics Lab & Control Lab at IIT Patna, and AWaDH at IIT Ropar. These experiences allowed me to delve into fascinating projects such as designing robotic grippers, developing autonomous agricultural robots, and conducting hydrodynamic analysis of bio-inspired fishes, among others.

It was during this time that my interest in robotics and automation flourished, sparking a passion for solving complex engineering challenges.

In pursuit of expanding my knowledge and skills, I embarked on a transformative academic journey abroad, obtaining a Master 2 Level Diploma in Constraint Programming with Applications to Mobile Robotics from ROBEX, Lab-STICC, ENSTA Bretagne in France. This experience broadened my horizons and deepened my expertise in robotics software engineering.

Beyond academics and engineering, I firmly believe in giving back to society. I have volunteered with NGOs, assisting in educational projects and teaching underprivileged students. These experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded individual, emphasizing the importance of empathy and social responsibility.
