Welcome to my portfolio website! I am an incoming graduate student at the University of California San Diego. I will pursue a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering specializing in Control & Mechatronics.
</p>
<p align="justify">
My academic journey began at Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology (TIET) in Patiala, India, where I completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Mechatronics Engineering. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
 I undertook research positions at various esteemed institutions, including the Mechatronics LAB at TIET, TIET-Tel Aviv University Centre for Food Security (T2CEFS), Mechatronics Lab & Control Lab at IIT Patna, and AWaDH at IIT Ropar. These experiences allowed me to delve into fascinating projects in Industrial, Agricultural, Swarm, Bioinspired and Soft robotics.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In my relentless quest to enhance my knowledge and skill set, I embarked on a transformative academic journey that led me to obtain a Master 2 Level Diploma in Constraint Programming with Applications to Mobile Robotics. This accomplishment was achieved through my participation in the prestigious ICRA2020 event, where I actively engaged in insightful sessions and workshops online. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Beyond academics and engineering, I firmly believe in giving back to society. I have volunteered with NGOs, assisting in educational projects and teaching underprivileged students. These experiences have shaped me into a well-rounded individual, emphasizing the importance of empathy and social responsibility.</p>
